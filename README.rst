Intranet3 (Ion) is the next-generation Intranet platform for TJHSST. Using Python, Django, Redis, Postgres, and many other technologies, Ion was developed from the ground up to be simple, well-documented, and extensible.

Documentation (in RestructuredText format) is available inside the "docs" folder or at http://tjcsl.github.io/ion/ publicly on the web.

Version 3.0.0
